# AIDLC — AI Development Lifecycle

A standardized, version-driven development workflow for AI agents working on codebases.

> Version: 2.1.0

## Core Philosophy

**版本驱动开发 (Version-Driven Development)**

Every development task starts with a version declaration — a version number and a one-line description of what this version delivers. This declaration becomes the anchor for the entire workflow: progress is tracked against it, phases are recorded under it, and the task is not complete until the version is committed.

The version log serves as a living history of the project's evolution, readable by both humans and agents.

## Cross-Session Memory

AI agent conversations are ephemeral — context resets on every new session. AIDLC solves this with two mechanisms:

### Design Notes (`design/todo.md`)

A gitignored file that persists **discussion conclusions, design decisions, deferred ideas, and next steps** across sessions. This is the agent's long-term memory for the project.

- Agent **reads** this file in Phase 0 (Orientation) — every new session starts by catching up
- Agent **writes** to this file when preserving context (see below) or when a discussion produces decisions worth remembering
- Format: date-stamped sections with tagged items (✅ decided, ⬜ todo, ❌ rejected)

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD

- ✅ Decided to keep X because Y
- ⬜ Refactor Z into shared module
- ❌ Rejected approach A — tested, doesn't work because B
```

### Context Preservation (保护现场)

When the human says **"保护现场"**, **"save context"**, **"先存一下"**, or similar — the agent immediately:

1. **Save code changes**: `git stash` or `git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: "` — whichever is appropriate
2. **Save discussion context**: append to `design/todo.md` with:
   - Conclusions reached in this session
   - Decisions made and their reasoning
   - Unfinished work and next steps
   - Open questions
3. **Confirm**: report what was saved (stash/commit hash + todo.md summary)

This ensures nothing is lost when a session ends unexpectedly, the human switches tasks, or context window fills up.

### Setup

On first run, AIDLC adds `design/` to `.gitignore` alongside `OPERATIONS.md` and `versions/`. These are local working files, not committed to the repository.

## First Run

When this skill is activated for the first time on a project:

1. Detect whether this is an **existing project** or a **new (empty) project**
2. Follow the appropriate path below
3. Generate `OPERATIONS.md` at the project root using the template (all 3 parts)
4. Create the `version_log_dir` directory (default: `versions/`)
5. Create `design/` directory with an empty `todo.md`
6. Add `OPERATIONS.md`, `version_log_dir`, and `design/` to `.gitignore`
7. On subsequent tasks, read `OPERATIONS.md` and follow the 7 phases

> `OPERATIONS.md` and `versions/` are local to each developer/agent. They must not be committed.

### Path A: Existing Project

Analyze the codebase and fill in the template based on what exists.

### Path B: New Project

When the project root is empty (or only has a README / LICENSE):

1. **Ask human** for: project name, language/framework, and purpose (one sentence)
2. Scaffold the minimum viable structure:
   - Package manifest (e.g. `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`)
   - Entry point (e.g. `main.py`, `src/index.ts`)
   - Test directory + one placeholder test
   - `.gitignore` (language-appropriate)
   - `scratch_dir` (gitignored)
   - `versions/` directory (gitignored)
3. Fill `OPERATIONS.md` with the scaffolded paths
4. Commit the scaffold as `v0.1.0: initial scaffold`

> After scaffold, all 7 phases apply normally. The first real task starts at Phase 1.

### Analysis Checklist

When analyzing a project, the agent MUST investigate:

- **Entry point**: what starts the program (`main.py`, `src/index.ts`, `cmd/main.go`, etc.)
- **Version source**: where the canonical version lives (`VERSION`, `package.json:version`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)
- **Test infrastructure**: runner command, test directory, existing test count/style
- **Build/deploy**: Dockerfile, CI config, Makefile — anything that breaks if code changes
- **Core modules**: files that >50% of the codebase depends on (these become Protected Files)
- **Infrastructure files**: test helpers, shared utilities, base classes — breakage cascades silently
- **Version sync points**: all files that embed the version string (README changelog, skill files, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- **Scratch directory**: existing or conventional location for throwaway code (must be gitignored)
- **Sensitive patterns**: project-specific secrets beyond the defaults (API keys, tokens, credentials)

## Version Log System

Each development task produces a version log file in the `version_log_dir` (default: `versions/`).

### Directory Structure

```
versions/
├── v1.2.0.md     # completed
├── v1.2.1.md     # completed
└── v1.3.0.md     # in progress (current)
```

### Version Log File Format

Created at Phase 1 (Design), updated as each phase completes:

```markdown
# v<version> — <description>

- Started: <timestamp>
- Completed: <timestamp>
- Status: 🔄 In Progress | ✅ Committed | ❌ Abandoned

## Plan
- Files to modify:
- Risk:

## Progress
- [x] Phase 0: Orientation
- [x] Phase 1: Design — <timestamp>
- [x] Phase 2: Scratch — <timestamp>
- [ ] Phase 3: Implement
- [ ] Phase 4: Test
- [ ] Phase 5: Docs
- [ ] Phase 6: Pre-commit
- [ ] Phase 7: Commit

## Notes
```

### Rules

- One file per version, named `v<version>.md`
- Agent creates the file at Phase 1 and updates it at each phase transition
- When Phase 7 completes, status changes to `✅ Committed`, fill in `Completed` timestamp
- If a task is abandoned (human says stop, or approach is unviable), status changes to `❌ Abandoned` with a reason in Notes; any uncommitted changes should be reverted or stashed
- `OPERATIONS.md` always reflects the current version being worked on
- **Single-version lock**: only one version may be `in-progress` at a time. To start a new version, the current one must be committed or abandoned first

## OPERATIONS.md Template

The generated file has three parts:

- **Part 1: Project Profile** — static analysis results
- **Part 2: Current Version** — the active version declaration and progress
- **Part 3: Development Phases** — actionable workflow with project-specific commands

Agent MUST generate all three parts.

````markdown
# OPERATIONS — Project Development Guide

Generated by AIDLC v2.0.0. Local to this workspace, do not commit.

---

## Part 1: Project Profile

### Project Info

```yaml
name: ""
version_file: ""          # e.g. VERSION, package.json, Cargo.toml
entry_point: ""            # e.g. main.py, src/index.ts
test_runner: ""            # e.g. bash test/test.sh, npm test, pytest
test_dir: ""               # e.g. test/, tests/, __tests__/
scratch_dir: ""            # e.g. test/scratch/ (must be gitignored)
build_cmd: ""              # e.g. docker compose build, make, npm run build (leave empty if none)
docs: []                   # files to update per release
version_sync: []           # ALL files that embed the version (changelog, skill, manifest...)
version_log_dir: "versions/"  # directory for version progress files (gitignored)
commit_convention: ""      # e.g. conventional, semver-prefix, free-form
```

### Architecture

One-paragraph summary of how the system works, data flow, and key design decisions.
Agent fills this in based on codebase analysis. Keep it under 5 lines.

### Read Order

Files to read (in order) to understand the codebase. Split into **must-read** (core flow) and **on-demand** (read when relevant):

#### Must Read
```
1.
2.
3.
```

#### On Demand
```
-
-
```

### Protected Files

Modifying these requires **human confirmation**.

> Include both **core modules** (high fan-in: many files import them) and
> **infrastructure files** (test helpers, shared utilities, base configs).
> Ask: "if this file has a bug, how much breaks — and how silently?"

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|

### Sensitive Patterns

Reject commit if these appear in diff:
```
token=.{8,}
api.key=.{8,}
password=
secret=
```

> Add project-specific patterns below (e.g. `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=`).

---

## Part 2: Current Version

> This section is updated by the agent at each phase transition.
> When no task is active, it shows "No active version."

```yaml
version: ""           # e.g. 1.3.0
description: ""       # one-line: what this version delivers
status: "idle"        # idle | in-progress | pre-commit | committed → idle
current_phase: ""     # e.g. Phase 3: Implement
log_file: ""          # e.g. versions/v1.3.0.md
```

---

## Part 3: Development Phases

### Phase 0: Orientation

Read the project. Understand before you change.

1. Read this file — review project profile, architecture, and read order
2. Read files listed in **Must Read**
3. Check `version_file` — confirm current version
4. Browse `test_dir` — understand existing coverage
5. Check `version_log_dir` — review recent version history for context
6. Read `design/todo.md` — catch up on pending tasks, decisions, and deferred ideas from previous sessions

**Rule: 先读后写，不懂不动。**

### Phase 1: Design — Version Declaration

> **This is where every task begins.** No code without a version.

1. **Declare version**: ask human (or determine from context) the target version number
   - patch (x.y.Z): bug fix, config change, docs-only
   - minor (x.Y.0): new feature, non-breaking change
   - major (X.0.0): breaking change, architectural shift
   - when in doubt, ask human
2. **Declare description**: one-line summary of what this version delivers
3. List files to modify
4. Check against **Protected Files** → if hit, **STOP, ask human**
5. Present plan to human
6. **Create version log**: write `<version_log_dir>/v<version>.md` with plan and initial progress
7. **Update Part 2** of `OPERATIONS.md` with the new version info, status `in-progress`

### Phase 2: Scratch Validation

Write throwaway code in `scratch_dir` to prove the idea works.

```bash
mkdir -p <scratch_dir>
# write: <scratch_dir>/try_<feature>.sh (or .py, .ts, etc.)
# run and verify
```

`scratch_dir` is gitignored. Nothing here gets committed.

Goals: prove feasibility, discover integration issues, fail fast.

> **Skip condition**: trivial changes (one-line fix, docs-only, config tweak) may skip this phase. Note "Phase 2: skipped (trivial)" in version log.

✏️ Update version log: check off Phase 2, add timestamp.

### Phase 3: Implement

Minimal code to make it work.

- Only code that directly serves the requirement
- No drive-by refactors
- No test modifications unless human requests
- Keep validating with scratch scripts

✏️ Update version log: check off Phase 3, add timestamp.

### Phase 4: Formal Test

Promote scratch tests to real tests.

1. Create/update test files in `test_dir` (match existing style)
2. Register in test runner if needed
3. Run full suite — no regressions:
   ```bash
   <test_runner>
   ```
4. If `build_cmd` is set, verify build still works:
   ```bash
   <build_cmd>
   ```
5. New code failures → fix. Pre-existing flaky → document, don't block.

✏️ Update version log: check off Phase 4, record test results in Notes.

### Phase 5: Documentation

1. Update files in `docs` list
2. Update `version_file`
3. Sync version to all `version_sync` files
4. No secrets in any committed file

✏️ Update version log: check off Phase 5.

### Phase 6: Pre-commit Checklist

Update `OPERATIONS.md` Part 2 status to `pre-commit`.

All must pass before commit:

```bash
# 1. Full test suite
<test_runner>

# 2. Build (if applicable)
<build_cmd>

# 3. Version consistency
V=$(cat <version_file> | tr -d '[:space:]')
for f in <version_sync>; do
  grep -q "$V" "$f" && echo "✅ $f" || echo "❌ $f"
done

# 4. Secrets scan
git diff --cached | grep -iE '<sensitive_patterns>' && echo "❌ SECRETS" || echo "✅ Clean"

# 5. No unintended changes
git diff --stat
```

Checklist:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds (if applicable)
- [ ] Version file updated
- [ ] Version consistent across sync files
- [ ] No secrets in diff
- [ ] No unintended changes

✏️ Update version log: check off Phase 6.

### Phase 7: Commit & Push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "v<version>: <description>"
git push
```

After successful push:
1. Update version log: check off Phase 7, set status to `✅ Committed`, fill in `Completed` timestamp
2. Update `OPERATIONS.md` Part 2: reset all fields to empty, status back to `idle`

✏️ The version is now closed. Next task starts fresh from Phase 0.
````

> **Key rule**: In Phase 6, the agent MUST substitute `<test_runner>`, `<build_cmd>`, `<version_file>`, `<version_sync>`, and `<sensitive_patterns>` with actual values from the Project Info section. The pre-commit checklist must be copy-paste executable — no placeholders left.

## The 7 Phases (Reference)

This section is the canonical definition. The template above embeds a project-specific copy into each `OPERATIONS.md`.

### Phase 0: Orientation

Read the project. Understand before you change.

1. Read `OPERATIONS.md` — review project profile, architecture, and read order
2. Read files listed in **Must Read**
3. Check `version_file` — confirm current version
4. Browse `test_dir` — understand existing coverage
5. Check `version_log_dir` — review recent version history for context
6. Read `design/todo.md` — catch up on pending tasks, decisions, and deferred ideas from previous sessions

> **Hot start**: if the previous version was just committed in this session, steps 1–4 can be skimmed rather than fully re-read.

**Rule: 先读后写，不懂不动。**

### Phase 1: Design — Version Declaration

> **This is where every task begins.** No code without a version.

1. **Declare version**: ask human (or determine from context) the target version number

   - when in doubt, ask human
2. **Declare description**: one-line summary of what this version delivers
3. List files to modify
4. Check against **Protected Files** → if hit, **STOP, ask human**
5. Present plan to human
6. **Create version log**: write `<version_log_dir>/v<version>.md`
7. **Update Part 2** of `OPERATIONS.md`: version, description, status `in-progress`, current_phase, log_file

### Phase 2: Scratch Validation

Write throwaway code in `scratch_dir` to prove the idea works.

```bash
mkdir -p <scratch_dir>
# write: <scratch_dir>/try_<feature>.sh
# run: bash <scratch_dir>/try_<feature>.sh

```

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds (if applicable)
- [ ] Version file updated
- [ ] Version consistent across sync files
- [ ] No secrets in diff
- [ ] `git diff` — no unintended changes

✏️ Update version log, set `OPERATIONS.md` Part 2 status to `pre-commit`.

git push
```

After successful push:
1. Version log: status → `✅ Committed`, fill in `Completed` timestamp
2. `OPERATIONS.md` Part 2: reset all fields to empty, status back to `idle`

✏️ Version closed. Next task starts fresh from Phase 0.

## Quick Reference

```
Phase 0  Orientation       Read OPERATIONS.md, understand context, review version history
Phase 1  Design & Declare  Declare version + description, plan, create version log
Phase 2  Scratch Validate  MVP in scratch_dir (not committed)
Phase 3  Implement         Minimal code, no side effects
Phase 4  Formal Test       Promote to real tests, full regression
Phase 5  Documentation     Update docs, bump version, sync version
Phase 6  Pre-commit        Tests + build + version sync + secrets scan
Phase 7  Commit & Push     Ship it, close version log
```

## Version Log Lifecycle

```
Phase 1 ──→ CREATE version log (status: 🔄 In Progress)
                ↓
Phase 2-6 → UPDATE progress checkboxes + timestamps
                ↓
Phase 7 ──→ CLOSE version log (status: ✅ Committed)
                ↓
         ──→ RESET OPERATIONS.md Part 2 to idle
```
